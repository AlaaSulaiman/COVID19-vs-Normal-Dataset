# COVID19-vs-Normal-dataset
 
To build this dataset, several sources of chest X-rays images were thoroughly examined to create relatively large-scale chest X-ray images with confirmed COVID-19, which is referred to as COVID19-vs-Normal dataset to be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 virus. Firstly, a collection of 200 chest X-ray images diagnosed with COVID-19 was collected from [Cohen's GitHub repository](https://radiopaedia.org/search?lang=us&q=covid&scope=cases#collapse-by-diagnostic-certainties). This repository is constantly updated with X-ray images shared by many researchers around the world. Secondly, the other 200 chest X-ray images diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from three different sources, namely [Radiopaedia dataset](https://www.sirm.org/en/italian-society-of-medical-and-interventional-radiology/), [Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data), and [Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)](). To have a balanced dataset, a collection of 400 chest X-ray images of the normal condition were collected from [Kaggleâ€™s Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia%20%20%20). Some samples of the positive and negative cases from the created COVID19-vs-Normal dataset are depicted below. The number of the COVID-19 cases will continuously updated accordingly with the availability of new X-ray images with confirmed COVID-19, and the whole dataset is available publicly for academic research purposes in this [repository](https://github.com/AlaaSulaiman/COVID19-vs-Normal-dataset).
